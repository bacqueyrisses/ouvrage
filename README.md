## ðŸ”¨ Problem
Over the last two years, I've gathered a collection of 450 wonderful words on my iPhone. Each word is unique and beautiful, but I hardly ever look at them in my note app.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution 
To fix this, I've made a website where I can share my cherished collection taken from my iCloud note app. Every day, you'll discover a new word showcased, poised to inspire you.

## ðŸ“š Introducing "Ouvrage"
Delight in the wonders of language, explore new vocabulary, and witness the beauty of words brought to life. Join me on this linguistic journey, and together, let's celebrate the splendor of language and build a world of beautiful words.
