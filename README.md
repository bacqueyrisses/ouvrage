## ðŸ”¨ Problem
For the past two years, I've been creating a collection of over 450 beautiful words that I carry everyone, on my iPhone. Each word holds a unique allure, but I actually never look at my note app...

## ðŸ’¡ Solution 
To remedy this, I've created this website where I can share my beloved collection that is scrapped from my iCloud note app. Every day, you'll find a new word displayed, ready to and inspire you.

I'll be adding a personal space so, you can also, create your very own list of favorite words. With the addition of a personal identification feature, you can contribute to this shared treasury and add words that resonate with you.

## ðŸ“š Ouvrage
Delight in the wonders of language, explore new vocabulary, and witness the beauty of words brought to life. Join me on this linguistic journey, and together, let's celebrate the splendor of language and build a world of beautiful words.
